While being the most basic substance involved in summoning, {light_purple}Conjuration Essence{} is still of utmost importance. It embodies 
the most basic properties all souls share and is therefore involved in the creation of many more capable materials.


One can obtain some essence of their own from {gold}breaking ordinary spawners{} as well as {gold}plundering chests{}.

;;;;;

For when a less concentrated material is required, simply {gold}sneak-right-clicking{} some essence on any stone-like surface 
smashes it into 4 pieces of {light_purple}Lesser Conjuration Essence{}
